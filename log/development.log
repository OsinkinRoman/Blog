А. Столыпина. Университет был открыт как Николаевский университет. Торжественное открытие состоялось 6 декабря с согласия императора Николая II дать университету своё имя. В тот же день после молебна и крестного хода был заложен камень на месте строительства будущих корпусов университета. Для их возведения в качестве архитектора будет привлечён Карл Людвигович Мюфке. За несколько лет ему удастся создать целостный ансамбль с высоким качеством исполнения.  Первым ректором Николаевского Саратовского университета стал Василий Иванович Разумовский. Первоначально в составе университета был только один факультет – медицинский. В 1917 году были созданы физико-математический, историко-филологический и юридический факультеты. Деканом историко-филологического факультета стал Семён Людвигович Франк. В университете работал П. К. Галлер. В первые послереволюционные годы на агрономическом факультете работал Н. И. Вавилов.  В 1922 году агрономический факультет был преобразован в самостоятельный Сельскохозяйственный институт.  В октябре 1923 года университет был переименован в Саратовский государственный университет им. Н. Г. Чернышевского.  В 1930 году медицинский факультет был преобразован в институт. В 1931 году на базе факультета советского строительства и права был создан институт советского права, который стал основоположником для Саратовской государственной академии права. В этом же году педагогический факультет стал институтом."}, "commit"=>"Save Post", "id"=>"3"}

А. Столыпина. Университет был открыт как Николаевский университет. Торжественное открытие состоялось 6 декабря с согласия императора Николая II дать университету своё имя. В тот же день после молебна и крестного хода был заложен камень на месте строительства будущих корпусов университета. Для их возведения в качестве архитектора будет привлечён Карл Людвигович Мюфке. За несколько лет ему удастся создать целостный ансамбль с высоким качеством исполнения.  Первым ректором Николаевского Саратовского университета стал Василий Иванович Разумовский. Первоначально в составе университета был только один факультет – медицинский. В 1917 году были созданы физико-математический, историко-филологический и юридический факультеты. Деканом историко-филологического факультета стал Семён Людвигович Франк. В университете работал П. К. Галлер. В первые послереволюционные годы на агрономическом факультете работал Н. И. Вавилов.  В 1922 году агрономический факультет был преобразован в самостоятельный Сельскохозяйственный институт.  В октябре 1923 года университет был переименован в Саратовский государственный университет им. Н. Г. Чернышевского.  В 1930 году медицинский факультет был преобразован в институт. В 1931 году на базе факультета советского строительства и права был создан институт советского права, который стал основоположником для Саратовской государственной академии права. В этом же году педагогический факультет стал институтом."], ["updated_at", "2020-05-13 14:56:01.525253"], ["id", 3]]
